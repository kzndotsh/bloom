# Components I

## Project Description

In this project we are going to be building a news feed reader. The goal is to have a collapsing menu, and expandable news articles. The styles and some of the HTML is already done for you.

## Git Setup

* [ ] Create a forked copy of this project.
* [ ] Clone your OWN version of the repository.
* [ ] Implement the project on the main branch, committing changes regularly.
* [ ] Push commits: `git push origin main`.

## Running the project

This project uses [Webpack and Babel](https://bloomtech-1.wistia.com/medias/bhi99dwr2x). When the project starts, Webpack transcompiles the LESS into CSS, and injects the JavaScript and the styles into the HTML.

Do not **move or rename any files** in this project. The website's source files live inside the `src` folder. Do not make changes to any files outside of the `src` folder, unless it's new dependecies declared in the `package.json` due to installing NPM libraries (E.G. `npm i lodash`).

* [ ] Run `npm install` to download the project's dependencies.
* [ ] Run `npm start` to launch the website on `http://localhost:3000`.

## MVP

### The Articles Component

* [ ] Follow the instructions found in the Articles.js file to complete the JavaScript functionality and add the components to the DOM.

* [ ] Add a few articles of your own to the data array. Notice how our JavaScript code automatically creates the new articles. Write the code once and add as many components as you want all while maintaining the functionality we built!

### The Menu Component

* [ ] Follow the instructions found in the Menu.js file to complete the JavaScript functionality.

## Submission Format

* [ ] Paste a link to your repo into the appropriate canvas input.
